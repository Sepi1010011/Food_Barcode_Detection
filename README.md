🚀 Overview

In large chain stores, optimizing operations can significantly impact profitability. Key factors influencing a store's success include customers, human resources, store layout, and inventory management. By leveraging modern technologies, we can enhance the shopping experience, streamline operations, and reduce costs.

This project aims to develop a smart solution that allows customers to scan and process their purchases using their smartphones. This approach facilitates faster transactions, minimizes reliance on human cashiers, and enhances the overall efficiency of the store.

🔍 Project Goals

    📱 Enable customers to scan product barcodes using their smartphones.
    ⚡ Speed up the shopping process by reducing checkout time.
    🤖 Utilize computer vision for barcode detection.
    🔢 Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for reading barcode numbers.
    🔗 Implement OpenCV and advanced object detection models for precise barcode identification.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    OpenCV – For image processing and barcode detection.
    Object Detection Models – To identify barcode regions in images.
    OCR (Tesseract or similar) – For extracting numerical information from barcodes.

📌 Future Enhancements

    Integration with a store's inventory system.
    Real-time price fetching and product information display.
    AI-based recommendation system for personalized shopping.
